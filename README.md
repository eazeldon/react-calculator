# React-hooks Project Calculator
https://eazeldon.github.io/react-calculator/

## User story
In 2022 I was an intern at Plexian. One of my tasks was to create a calculator for iPad and desktop usage. The purpose of this was to learn and understand the functionalities of how react-hooks work. 

I had fun doing this project, and realized it’s not so hard to learn new things. I received great feedback about this project because I understood  the code and how to design a calculator.


## Features
Calculator have the following feature sets:  addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, undo, reset, percent, +/-, and clock.

## Testing
It was tested live on a MacBook Pro 15” screen, with MacOS ver. 10.14.6 and Google Chrome and Safari browsers, iPad mini4, with iOS ver., iPad Air 5th generation with iPadOS 17.2 using the Safari browser,

## Acknowledgement
The code is from a learning path open source for student and beginners

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
